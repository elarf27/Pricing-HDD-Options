## Contribution and improvements

This project represents an ongoing exploration into weather derivatives pricing and trading, a field I am deeply passionate about. While the current implementation provides a solid foundation, there is ample room for enhancement and sophistication. I am actively seeking collaborators who share an interest in this field and can bring complementary skills or insights to the project. If you are passionate about financial modeling, weather analysis, or related fields, I would be excited to discuss potential partnerships.
